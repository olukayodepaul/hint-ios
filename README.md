Perfect ðŸ‘Œ â€” letâ€™s build this cleanly from scratch so you get a new **iOS app project** that uses **Swift Package Manager (`Package.swift`)** and Alamofire (or any other lib) as a dependency.

---

## ðŸš€ Step 1: Create a New Swift Package Project

In Terminal:

```bash
mkdir MyNewApp
cd MyNewApp
swift package init --type executable
```

This gives you:

```
MyNewApp/
 â”œâ”€â”€ Package.swift
 â”œâ”€â”€ Sources/
 â”‚    â””â”€â”€ MyNewApp/main.swift
 â””â”€â”€ Tests/
      â””â”€â”€ MyNewAppTests/
```

Here, `main.swift` is the entry point.
Since weâ€™re targeting **iOS app**, weâ€™ll adjust things.

---

## ðŸš€ Step 2: Add iOS Platform + Dependencies

Edit `Package.swift`:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.9
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyNewApp",
    platforms: [
        .iOS(.v16) // âœ… target iOS 16
    ],
    products: [
        .executable(name: "MyNewApp", targets: ["MyNewApp"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
        // âœ… Add Alamofire here
        .package(url: "https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git", exact: "5.9.1")
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "MyNewApp",
            dependencies: ["Alamofire"]
        ),
        .testTarget(
            name: "MyNewAppTests",
            dependencies: ["MyNewApp"]
        )
    ]
)
```

---

## ðŸš€ Step 3: Open in Xcode

From inside `MyNewApp` folder:

```bash
xed .
```

This opens it in Xcode as a **Swift Package project**.
Youâ€™ll see `Package.swift` and the sources.

---

## ðŸš€ Step 4: Turn into an iOS App

Since `swift package init --type executable` just creates a console program, you need to:

1. In Xcode, **File â†’ New â†’ Target â†’ iOS App**.
2. Give it a name (still inside `MyNewApp` workspace).
3. Use SwiftUI or UIKit.
4. The `Package.swift` dependencies (like Alamofire) will already be available.

---

Now youâ€™ve got:

* âœ… A proper iOS app targeting iOS 16.
* âœ… Managed with `Package.swift`.
* âœ… Alamofire added by version.

---

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to write out the **exact Package.swift + SwiftUI App starter code** (so you can literally run and see Alamofire working), or keep it minimal and empty?
